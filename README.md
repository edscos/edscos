- 👋 Hi, I’m @edscos
- 👀 I’m interested in remote sensing applied to environmental studies.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing creative ways to implement remote sensing of evapotranspiration algorithms in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding strategies to optimize algorithms for remote sensing data assimilation.
- 📫 How to reach me: edscos@colostate.edu or edscos@rams.colostate.edu.
